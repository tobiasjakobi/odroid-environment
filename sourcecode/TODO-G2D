g2d/kernel:
- check performance if multiple cmdlists are processed together
- constify some pointers, e.g. the g2d_image one in g2d_solid_fill
- dst select reg has some restrictions concerning scaling + YCbCr
- reimplement userptr support using code from:
  https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/gpu/drm/etnaviv/etnaviv_gem.c
- componentize the driver, add probe deferral and add proper devfreq handling

reset / infinite loop test:
- check if we can even force a loop by putting together cmdlists
- when does the engine hang with the undefined color formats?
  (maybe only for solid fill ops?)
