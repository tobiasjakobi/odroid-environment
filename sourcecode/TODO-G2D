g2d/kernel:
- check performance if multiple cmdlists are processed together
- constify some pointers, e.g. the g2d_image one in g2d_solid_fill
- dst select reg has some restrictions concerning scaling + YCbCr
- g2d_close() should wait until the engine is idle
- queue_work() to g2d reset
- implement infinite loop test to check if reset works
- reimplement userptr support using code from:
